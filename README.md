# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project is aimed at developing a model for detecting cardiovascular diseases using a Kaggle dataset. Follow the steps below to download the dataset and set up the environment.

## Instructions for Downloading and Preparing the Dataset

1. Navigate to Kaggle using the following link: [Cardiovascular Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)

2. Download the zip file containing the dataset.

3. Unzip the file and place its contents inside a folder named "dataset".

4. Execute the entire notebook `preliminary_analysis_and_cleaning_of_the_dataset.ipynb` to complete the preparation of all datasets.

    - **4.1.** To do this, ensure you select the correct execution environment using the "environment" variable ("Google Colab" or "Local") in the first cell of the notebook.

    - **4.2.** If executing on Google Colab, also make sure that the "project_path" variable represents the correct path (as relative paths are not possible on Google Colab).
